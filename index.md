I’m currently an associate professor of the School of Economics and Management at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. 

I received my Ph.D. from the Industrial and System Engineering (ISE) department at North Carolina State Unversity in Dec 2013. 

Recently I’m interested in various approaches to making data-driven decisions in the context of revenue management, including dynamic programming and machine learning.

My research is also broadly related to mathematical optimization.
